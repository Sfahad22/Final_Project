# Name of project: Hunter's Journey: The Forest Curse. 
# I have uploaded my adventure game into this repository.
# Gameplay Instructions: In order to move on to the next chapter, players must battle all monsters, craftÂ weapons, and follow the story's relevant directions. Players can also set traps for monsters. 
# The game has dynamic combat elements, allowing the player to engage enemies by selecting actions such as "attack," "dodge," or "run." The consequences of these decisions determine success or failure in defeating monsters.
# Future advancements for the project include enhancing the warfare mechanics by including varied enemy strategies that necessitate adaptive tactics and establishing an inventory system for handling weapons and supplies effectively. Additionally, the story may be expanded by adding numerous endings dependent on player decisions, providing greater replayability, and introducing side missions to extend the plot and offer a more immersive and dynamic gaming experience.
